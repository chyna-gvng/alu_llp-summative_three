### Q2. CPythoning

Python and C are all great languages to use in tech space for a number of reasons. In this project, we have data entries from a temperature sensor in this [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eHqz-hVjPmWi4KExGTy_M6UC_5Ov34-9/view?usp=sharing), you are required to write a C Program that uses Python libraries and functions to determine the mean temperature, mode temperature, and the standard deviation. (Feel free to research on these statistical terms and how to compute the values)
